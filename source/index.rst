PROST: A quantitative pattern recognition framework for spatial transcriptomics 
====================================================================================================================================================================================

**PROST** is a flexible framework to quantify gene spatial expression patterns and detect spatial tissue domains using spatially resolved transcriptomics with various resolutions. `PROST` consists of two independent workflows: **PROST Index (PI)** and **PROST Neural Network (PNN)**.

Using **PROST** you can do: 

- Quantitative identification of spatial patterns of gene expression changes by the proposed **PROST Index (PI)**.
- Unsupervised identification of spatial tissue domains using a **PROST Neural Network (PNN)**.
